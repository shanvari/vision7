Features

7.1. Harris Corner Detector
7.1.1. Extract interest points using the Harris Corner detector that you implemented. In this way, apply the Harris Corner
detector for at least 4 different scales. Which interest points do you observe to be detected across all these
different scales? Notice that your implementation should allow for any suitable scale as input, however you can
show results on a minimum of 4 different scales (Test on harris.JPG Image).
7.2. Scene stitching with SIFT/SURF features
7.2.1. Use the OpenCV, Python, and MATLAB implementation of the SIFT or SURF operator to find interest points and
establish correspondences between the images. In this case you can directly compare the feature vectors of
interest points. You will match and align between different views of a scene with SIFT/SURF features. Discuss
results and demonstrates the output of each method separately (Test on sl,sm,sr.jpg images).
7.2.2. Do these steps by images that are taken with your own camera as well.
